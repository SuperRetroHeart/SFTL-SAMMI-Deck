The value can be manually edited by changing the\nINI file. This makes it a useful way to keep track of a number over\ntime; for example, the number of deaths in a Souls-like, the number\nof times a charater has taken a hit, new followers over the course\nof a stream, the number of times you've said the word \"triumvirate\",\nand so on.\n\nThis is provided primarily as an example as you'll need to create the\nINI and variables yourself. If you want a number that resets on command,\nyou can also create a button that changes the value back to zero, though\nkeep in mind that you'll also need to save that to the .INI (if you're\nusing one).\n\nIf no INI or variable exists at startup, the counter will default to 0\neach time SAMMI is started since there's nothing for it to pull the variable from.",

I use a \"streamstatus\"\nfolder in the same directory where SAMMI is installed for this.\n\nFor example, if SAMMI is located in:\n  C:\\/Users\\/Username\\/Stream\\/SAMMI\nThen it's recommended you place INI files in a subdirectory, like:\n  C:\\/Users\\/Username\\/Stream\\/SAMMI\\/streamstatus\n\nYou can have as many or as few .ini files as you want, it all depends on how you want to\norganize things.\n\nYou'll also need to set up your own INI for any INI command to work.\nFor the example below, you can create an INI with the following:\n\nFile name:\n  counters.ini\n                \nFile text:\n  [thing]\n  widgets=\"0\"",
