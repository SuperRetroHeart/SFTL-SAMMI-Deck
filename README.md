# Superfuture Technolabs Stream Deck for SAMMI
This is a collection of buttons and automations for the free [SAMMI stream deck software](https://github.com/SAMMISolutions/SAMMI-Official/releases) named (loosely) after the theming of my livestreams. Compiled into a single deck that can be imported into SAMMI, it contains Twitch alerts, on-screen trackers for things like followers and subscribers, a persistent counter, and various other tools for running streams on Twitch via SAMMI.

## Initial Setup
To get started, download [the SFTL Test Lab Files](https://github.com/SuperRetroHeart/Superfuture-Technlolabs-SAMMI-Deck/raw/main/SFTL%20Test%20Lab%20Files.zip) and unzip the contents directly to the root of your SAMMI directory. This will create a folder named "SFTLTestLab" which contains additional files that will be used as part of examples contained within the deck. If this folder or files are missing, certain buttons will not work.

Once the files have been unzipped, start up both OBS and SAMMI Core, then import the deck into SAMMI by doing the following:

1.) Copy all of the raw text from [the SFTL Stream Deck](https://github.com/SuperRetroHeart/Superfuture-Technlolabs-SAMMI-Deck/blob/main/SFTL%20Stream%20Deck%20v2.1.json), including the opening and closing {curly braces}.

2.) In SAMMI Core, click on the "+", and select "**Paste Deck**".

The deck will populate automatically; open it once, and you should see all the buttons as well as a preview when you save it. Once you've confirmed the deck has been added to SAMMI, open it and run the "Initialize SFTL Test Lab" button. This will create a new scene in OBS - called **SFTL Test Lab** - and populate it with a handful of sources that will be used by the buttons included in the deck.

Beyond that, additional information is included within each button, so please read those carefully to understand how they work and how you can integrate these buttons and concepts into your own streaming setup!

## Special Thanks
**a_bat's** ([Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/a_bat/videos)/[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH9Cz-87RLF2Aw0CjVTzAwQ)) YouTube channel, which I stumbled upon after a random search, was hugely helpful in getting me started with SAMMI. His tutorial on creating host alerts was particularly helpful in understanding data pulls and arrays, which ultimately formed the foundation of understanding how SAMMI works as a whole.

CodeChannel ([Twitch](https://twitch.tv/codechannel)/[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@codechannelVT)) for her help in being a sort of unofficial beta tester for The Chaos Roller and Persistent Thing Counter. And for being a cool cat.

If you found these buttons useful and managed to read this far, consider supporing me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/retroheart), following me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/superretroheart), checking out my [art](https://retroheart.net) or just [seeing where else to find me](http://links.retroheart.net). You don't have to, though. My sincere hope is that someone finds these things I'm making useful and entertaining. As long as someone's getting some use out of them, that's enough for me. That's all for now. See you next.
